# Skydiver Game

This project is a small Phaser prototype built with TypeScript and Vite.

## Gameplay Features
- Freefall and canopy phases with basic controls
- Rings to collect for points and updrafts to catch extra lift
- Score tracking displayed during play

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18 or later)
- npm

## Installation
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Game
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

By default Vite opens the browser automatically. If it does not, navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

npm run build
```
The output will be placed in the `dist` directory.
